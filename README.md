ReadMe file for the AnimeArray Personal Project Website by YuanKram

This is a Interactive Anime Listing Website and my very first project using APIs and Node.js w/ Express.js
*showcasing features such as:
*Filter anime list by categories or genres
*Search anime by title
*Paginate through anime lists for easier browsing
*Browse Each anime description in its own page.
*Fully responsive and clean UI design


Tools used:
*Vanilla JavaScript - for client side interactivity
*Node.js + Express.js framework - for backend requests and response
*JikanApi - for Anime API library
*Figma - for planning website designs, assets creation
*FontAwesome - for free vector icons

primary goal for this personal project:
Create modern design website for returning lists of animes with filtering functionalities

to be added functionalities in the future:
Full CRUD REST API Operations for saving anime in a local/cloud database
Account management system
Converting the current vanilla JS setup to React.js library for cleaner project structure
